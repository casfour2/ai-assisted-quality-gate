# AI-Assited Quality Gate

## Purpose
This repository is an exploratory implementation of automated testing, AI-assisted analysis, and CI/CD pipelines working together to produce actionable quality signals. It exists as a learning space to broaden understanding of how these techniques interact in practice.

## What This Is
- An exploratory, reference-style project
- A learning-focused repository for examining how automated testing, AI-assisted analysis, and CI/CD workflows can interact
- A structure-first implementation that emphasizes guardrails, intent, and quality signals over features
- A space for experimentation and iteration rather than a production-ready system

## What This Is Not
- A production-ready system or reference architecture
- A complete or finalized implementation
- A drop-in solution for real-world environments
- A benchmark, compliance framework, or best-practice guide
- An endorsement of specific tools, models, or vendors

## Repository Structure
- `app/` – Application code and execution surface
- `tests/` – Automated tests and validation logic
- `ai/` – AI-related logic, prompts, and model boundaries
- `.github/workflows/` – CI/CD workflows and automation policies
- `docker/` – Container definitions and runtime isolation

## Status
This project is in an early, exploratory stage. It is currently focused on establishing structure and intent. Functionality is incomplete and expected to evolve over time.
